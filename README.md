# 👋 Hi, I'm David Alberto!

I'm a **Pharmaceutical Chemist and Biologist** by profession, currently a PhD candidate in **Integrative Biology** at **Cinvestav**. My research focuses on elucidating the cytokinin signaling pathway in the filamentous fungus *Trichoderma atroviride*, with particular emphasis on bioinformatic analysis of transcriptomic and metagenomic data. 

My expertise lies in the intersection of molecular biology, microbiology, bioinformatics, and 'omics' sciences, and I’m especially skilled in **transcriptomic** and **metagenomic** approaches for fungal research.

> ***"Pursue excellence, and success will follow."***
