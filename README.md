### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm David Alberto

I'm a Pharmaceutical Chemist and Biologist by profession, I'm currently pursuing my PhD studies in **Integrative Biology** at the **Unidad de GenÃ³mica Avanzada** of **LANGEBIO** at **Cinvestav**. My PhD studies are focused on determining the cytokinin signaling pathway in the filamentous fungus *Trichoderma atroviride*. I'm interested in the analysis of transcriptomic and metagenomic data with the help of bioinformatics tools. 

***Pursue excellence and success will follow***

- ðŸ”­ I am currently working on finishing my Ph. 
- ðŸŒ± I am currently learning how to generate retrotransformants in Trichoderma atroviride.
- ðŸ‘¯ I am looking to collaborate in transcriptomic and metagenomic analysis.
- ðŸ¤” I am looking for help with script development.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about molecular biology and transcriptomic and metagenomic analysis.
